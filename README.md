# DAPI

Dynamic API will allow users to create an api with whatever data they provide
(ex: topic of baseball, DAPI will create a table titled 'baseball')
Provide a form for the user to fill out data, and subsequently fill out their table.  Routes are written to account for any topic (even check for boolean values).
