What needs to be in place for this to work:

-Dynamic SQL Routes (SQL that uses javascript function to 'write itself' and account for any input)
-Dynamic table creation (using temperate literals (if that is allowed?) and writing itself similar to SQL)
-Proper forms for the user to interact with (frontend), add/edit/delete features
-Get backend basic system working first, then maybe build out a viewing page for frontend, otherwise just forms
-Have tables tied to users with auth (stretch)

HOW:

For a dynamic table to exist, there must be protections against SQL injection.
Therefore, some limitiations must be in place, either regex restrictions (i.e. if(name contains 'DROP TABLES')),
or set the input value to a variable, then use that instead (maybe 'type' the variable)?
Table rows could probablly follow the dynamic route (auto fill SQL text around the variables),
you would need to have users provide: rowName, dataType (TEXT, INT, DIGIT, etc), NOT NULL would be automaticall appended.

All further routes and code would depend on these values and variables, so you would need
a way to not only take in these values, but also asses what they are and how they should be placed (boolean or not, string vs number, referrences another table, etc)

a true challenge, and it might not be secure if the user has so much control (but that is the point of the app after all)
